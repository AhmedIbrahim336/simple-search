      Among the many drivers of the tech ecosystem’s rapid growth, artificial
      intelligence (AI) and its subdomains are at the fore. Described by Gartner
      as the application of “advanced analysis and logic-based techniques” to
      simulate human intelligence, AI is an all-inclusive system with numerous
      use cases for individuals and enterprises across industries. There are
      many ways of leveraging AI to support, automate and augment human tasks,
      as seen by the range of solutions available today. These offerings promise
      to simplify complex tasks with speed and accuracy, and to spur new
      applications that were impractical or possible previously. Some question
      whether the technology will be used for good or perhaps become more
      effective than humans for certain business use cases, but its prevalence
      and popularity cannot be doubted. What is artificial intelligence (AI)
      software? AI software can be defined in several ways. First, a lean
      description would consider it to be software that is capable of simulating
      intelligent human behavior. However, a broader perspective sees it as a
      computer application that learns data patterns and insights to meet
      specific customer pain points intelligently. The AI software market
      includes not just technologies with built-in AI processes, but also the
      platforms that allow developers to build AI systems from scratch. This
      could range from chatbots to deep and machine learning software and other
      platforms with cognitive computing capabilities. Event MetaBeat 2022
      MetaBeat will bring together thought leaders to give guidance on how
      metaverse technology will transform the way all industries communicate and
      do business on October 4 in San Francisco, CA. Register Here To get a
      sense of the scope, AI encompasses the following: Machine learning (ML):
      Allows a computer to collect data and learn from it to generate insights.
      Deep learning (DL): A step further in ML used to detect patterns and
      trends in large volumes of data and learn from them. Neural networks:
      Interconnecting units that are designed to learn and recognize patterns,
      much like the human brain. Natural language processing (NLP): NLP supports
      AI’s ability to read, understand and process human language. Computer
      vision: Teaching computers to collect and interpret meaningful data from
      images and videos. These capabilities are leveraged to build AI software
      for different use cases, the top of which are knowledge management,
      virtual assistance and autonomous vehicles. With the large volumes of data
      that enterprises must comb through to meet customer demands, there’s an
      increased need for faster and more accurate software solutions. As
      expected, the rise in enterprise-level adoption of AI has led to
      accelerated market growth of the global AI software market. Gartner places
      the growth at an estimated $62.5 billion in 2022 — a 21.3% increase on its
      value in 2021. By 2025, IDC projects this market to reach $549.9 billion.
      4 critical functions of an AI solution Whether it powers surgical bots in
      healthcare, detects fraud in financial transactions, strengthens driver
      assistance technology in the automotive industry or personalizes learning
      content for students, the overarching purpose of AI solutions can be
      grouped into four broad functional categories, including: 1. Automate
      processes The automation function of AI applications meets AI’s primary
      objective to minimize human intervention in executing tasks, whether
      mundane and repetitive or complex and challenging. By collecting and
      interpreting volumes of data fed into it, an AI solution can be leveraged
      to determine the next steps in a process and execute it seamlessly. It
      does this by leveraging the capabilities of ML algorithms to create a
      knowledge base of structured and unstructured data. Process automation
      remains a top enterprise concern, with one survey exhibiting that 80% of
      companies expect to adopt intelligent automation in 2027. 2. Data analysis
      and interpretation A core function of AI solutions, especially for
      enterprises, is to create knowledge bases of structured and unstructured
      data and then analyze and interpret such data before making predictions
      and recommendations from its findings. This is called AI analytics and it
      uses machine learning to study data and draw patterns. Whether the
      analytic tools are predictive, prescriptive, augmented, or even
      descriptive, AI is at the center of determining how the data is prepared,
      discovering new insights and patterns and predicting business outcomes.
      Enterprises are also turning to AI for improved data quality. 3. User
      personalization and engagement Building a relationship has become the holy
      grail of customer acquisition and retention. A study from McKinsey shows
      that one sure way to do this is through personalization and engagement. AI
      technologies allow enterprises to make personalized offers to customers
      and predict and solve their concerns in real-time. This function manifests
      in programs like conversational chatbots and product recommendations
      generated from learned customer behavior. Many organizations are still
      getting up to speed with the technology. Gartner reports that 63% of
      digital marketers struggle to maximize personalization technology. Their
      survey of 350 marketing executives revealed that only 17% are actively
      using AI and ML solutions across the board, although 83% believe in its
      potency. 4. Business efficacy Along with greater automation of traditional
      processes, AI enables new services and capabilities that were not
      previously feasible. From driverless vehicles and natural language
      services for consumers to medical breakthroughs that could only have been
      imagined previously, AI is becoming the base of new products and markets
      that will continue to unfold. Also read: Creating responsible AI products
      using human oversight 10 top artificial intelligence (AI) software
      solutions in 2022 AI software solutions include general platforms for
      supporting a range of applications and products for more narrow,
      industry-specific use cases. We include a sampling of both in the
      following representative list. With 56% of organizations adopting AI for
      at least one business function, there are many options on the market
      today. Below are ten examples of AI software solutions available in 2022.
      Google Cloud AI Google’s dominant cloud offering includes assorted tools
      to support developer, data science and infrastructure use cases. Several
      speech and language translation tools, vision, audio and video tools and
      deep and machine earning capabilities bring AI functionality to skilled
      technology practitioners and mass consumer markets. Google was named a
      leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Cloud AI Developer Services in
      2022. IBM Watson Studio Like Google, IBM offers a platform for building
      and training AI software. The IBM Watson Studio provides a multicloud
      architecture for developers, data scientists and analysts to “build, run
      and manage”’ AI models collaboratively. With capabilities ranging from
      AutoAI to explainable AI, DL, model drift, modelops and model risk
      management, the studio gives subject-matter experts the tools they need to
      either gather and prepare data or create and train AI models. It also
      allows these professionals the flexibility to deploy AI models on either
      public or private cloud (IBM Cloud Pak, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or
      Amazon Web Services) and on-premises. IT teams can open source these
      models as they build them with embedded Waston tools like the Natural
      Language Classifier. Its hybrid environment may also provide developers
      with more data access and agility. Salesforce Einstein Named a leader in
      Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for CRM Customer Engagement Center thirteen times
      in a row and the #1 CRM solution for eight consecutive years by the
      International Data Corporation (IDC), Salesforce provides an advanced kit
      of sales, marketing and customer experience tools. Salesforce Einstein is
      an AI product that helps companies identify patterns in customer data.
      This platform has a set of built-in AI technologies supporting the
      Einstein bots, prediction builder, forecasting, commerce cloud Einstein,
      service cloud Einstein, marketing cloud Einstein and other functions.
      Users and developers of new and existing cloud applications can also
      deploy the platform’s predictive and suggestive capabilities into their
      models. For example, at Salesforce Einstein’s launch in 2016, John Ball,
      general manager at Einstein, revealed that by creating Einstein, the
      company “enables sales professionals to find better prospects and close
      more deals through predictive lead scoring and automatic data capture to
      convert leads into opportunities and opportunities into deals.” Oculeus
      Oculeus provides an industry-specific solution. For service providers,
      network operators and enterprises in the telecom industry that need to
      protect and defend their communication infrastructure against cyber
      threats, Oculeus offers a portfolio of software-based solutions that can
      help them better manage network operations. According to founder and CEO
      Arnd Baranowski, Oculeus uses AI and automation “to learn about an
      enterprise’s regular communications traffic and continually monitor it for
      exceptions to a baseline of expected communications activities. With its
      AI-driven technologies, suspicious traffic can be identified, investigated
      and blocked within milliseconds. This is done before any significant
      financial damage is caused to the enterprise and protects the brand
      reputation of the telecoms service provider.” The Communications Fraud
      Control Association (CFCA)’s 2021 survey of international
      telecommunication fraud loss discovered losses amounting to over $39.89
      billion, a 28% increase in losses over the previous year. Similarly,
      network security and operators are experiencing more fraud threats and
      attacks. Among other things, these insights amplify the need for
      enterprises to switch to a proactive defense approach that outwits
      adversaries, and this what Oculeus claims to provide with its AI-powered
      telecoms fraud protection solutions. In Baranowski’s words, Oculeus’
      AI-driven approach to telecoms fraud protection does not only “…stop
      fraudulent telecommunications traffic before any significant financial
      damage is caused” but also includes extensive automation tools that weed
      out threats thoroughly. Edsoma Edsoma represents another narrow use case.
      Its AI-based reading application software features real-time, exclusive
      voice identification and recognition technology designed to uncover the
      strengths and weaknesses in children’s reading. This follow-along
      technology identifies users’ spoken words and speaking speed to determine
      if they are saying the words correctly. A correction program helps put
      them back on track if they mispronounce something. As Edsoma founder and
      CEO Kyle Wallgren explained, once “…the electronic book is read, the
      child’s voice is transcribed in real-time by the automated speech
      recognition (ASR) system and immediate results are provided, including
      pronunciation assessment, phonetics, timing and other facets. These
      metrics are compiled to help teachers and parents make informed decision.”
      This technology aims to improve children’s oral reading fluency skills and
      provide them the necessary support to inculcate a healthy reading culture.
      Edsoma seeks to establish a share of the $127 billion global edtech
      market. By leveraging real-time data to provide real-time literacy, Edsoma
      looks to provide future-focused learning powered by AI. Appen Appen has
